**The self-improving AI agent built by [Nous Research](https://nousresearch.com).** It's the only agent with a built-in learning loop — it creates skills from experience, improves them during use, nudges itself to persist knowledge, searches its own past conversations, and builds a deepening model of who you are across sessions. Run it on a $5 VPS, a GPU cluster, or serverless infrastructure that costs nearly nothing when idle. It's not tied to your laptop — talk to it from Telegram while it works on a cloud VM.

Use any model you want — [Nous Portal](https://portal.nousresearch.com), OpenRouter, OpenAI, your own endpoint, and [many others](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/integrations/providers). Switch with `hermes model` — no code changes, no lock-in.

## Quick Install

### Linux, macOS, WSL2, Termux

```bash
curl -fsSL https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/install.sh | bash
```

### Windows (native, PowerShell)

> **Heads up:** Native Windows runs Hermes without WSL — CLI, gateway, TUI, and tools all work natively. If you'd rather use WSL2, the Linux/macOS one-liner above works there too. Found a bug? Please [file issues](https://github.com/NousResearch/hermes-agent/issues).

Run this in PowerShell:

```powershell
iex (irm https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/install.ps1)
```

The installer handles everything: uv, Python 3.11, Node.js, ripgrep, ffmpeg, **and a portable Git Bash** (MinGit, unpacked to `%LOCALAPPDATA%\hermes\git` — no admin required, completely isolated from any system Git install). Hermes uses this bundled Git Bash to run shell commands.

If you already have Git installed, the installer detects it and uses that instead. Otherwise a ~45MB MinGit download is all you need — it won't touch or interfere with any system Git.

> **Android / Termux:** The tested manual path is documented in the [Termux guide](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/getting-started/termux). On Termux, Hermes installs a curated `.[termux]` extra because the full `.[all]` extra currently pulls Android-incompatible voice dependencies.
>
> **Windows:** Native Windows is fully supported — the PowerShell one-liner above installs everything. If you'd rather use WSL2, the Linux command works there too. Native Windows install lives under `%LOCALAPPDATA%\hermes`; WSL2 installs under `~/.hermes` as on Linux.

After installation:

```bash
source ~/.bashrc    # reload shell (or: source ~/.zshrc)
hermes              # start chatting!
```

### Troubleshooting

#### Windows Defender or antivirus flags `uv.exe` as malware

If your antivirus (Bitdefender, Windows Defender, etc.) quarantines `uv.exe` from the Hermes `bin` folder (`%LOCALAPPDATA%\hermes\bin\uv.exe`), this is a **false positive**. The file is Astral's `uv` — the Rust Python package manager Hermes bundles to manage its Python environment. ML-based antivirus engines commonly flag unsigned Rust binaries that download and install packages.

**To verify your copy is authentic:**

```powershell
# Install GitHub CLI if needed
winget install --id GitHub.cli

# Login to GitHub
gh auth login

# Run verification
$uv = "$env:LOCALAPPDATA\hermes\bin\uv.exe"
$ver = (& $uv --version).Split(' ')[1]
[Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol = [Net.SecurityProtocolType]::Tls12
$zip = "$env:TEMP\uv.zip"
Invoke-WebRequest "https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/releases/download/$ver/uv-x86_64-pc-windows-msvc.zip" -OutFile $zip -UseBasicParsing
gh attestation verify $zip --repo astral-sh/uv
Expand-Archive $zip "$env:TEMP\uv_x" -Force
(Get-FileHash "$env:TEMP\uv_x\uv.exe").Hash -eq (Get-FileHash $uv).Hash
```

If attestation says "Verification succeeded" and the last line prints `True`, you're good.

**To whitelist Hermes:**
- **Windows Defender:** Run PowerShell as Admin → `Add-MpPreference -ExclusionPath "$env:LOCALAPPDATA\hermes\bin"`
- **Bitdefender:** Add an exception in the Bitdefender console (Protection > Antivirus > Settings > Manage Exceptions)
- Whitelist the **folder**, not the file hash — Hermes updates `uv` and the hash changes every version

For more context, see the upstream Astral reports: [astral-sh/uv#13553](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/13553), [astral-sh/uv#15011](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/15011), [astral-sh/uv#10079](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/10079).

## Getting Started

```bash
hermes              # Interactive CLI — start a conversation
hermes model        # Choose your LLM provider and model
hermes tools        # Configure which tools are enabled
hermes config set   # Set individual config values
hermes config get   # Print individual config values
hermes gateway      # Start the messaging gateway (Telegram, Discord, etc.)
hermes setup        # Run the full setup wizard (configures everything at once)
hermes claw migrate # Migrate from OpenClaw (if coming from OpenClaw)
hermes update       # Update to the latest version
hermes doctor       # Diagnose any issues
```

## Skip the API-key collection — Nous Portal

Hermes works with whatever provider you want — that's not changing. But if you'd rather not collect five separate API keys for the model, web search, image generation, TTS, and a cloud browser, **[Nous Portal](https://portal.nousresearch.com)** covers all of them under one subscription:

- **300+ models** — pick any of them with `/model <name>`
- **Tool Gateway** — web search (Firecrawl), image generation (FAL), text-to-speech (OpenAI), cloud browser (Browser Use), all routed through your sub. No extra accounts.

One command from a fresh install:

```bash
hermes setup --portal
```

That logs you in via OAuth, sets Nous as your provider, and turns on the Tool Gateway. Check what's wired up any time with `hermes portal info`. Full details on the [Tool Gateway docs page](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/user-guide/features/tool-gateway).

You can still bring your own keys per-tool whenever you want — the gateway is per-backend, not all-or-nothing.

## Universal Multi-Agent Builder

Hermes can now operate as a **Universal Multi-Agent Builder**: give it a product or feature request, and it runs a structured pipeline that turns the request into production-ready code and ships it to GitHub.

### What it does

- **Recommender** — generates 3 implementation options and selects the best one
- **Roadmap** — defines phases, milestones, and dependencies
- **Architect** — designs technical architecture, stack, and integration contracts
- **Planner** — produces the complete file structure and function specs
- **Builder** — writes real, complete, publish-ready code
- **Verifier** — validates syntax, logic, and behavior
- **Auditor** — reviews security, performance, and quality
- **GitHub Agent** — commits and pushes the finished codebase

### Usage

```bash
hermes build "Build a todo API with FastAPI and SQLite"
hermes build --auto "Add Telegram bot integration"
hermes build --resume "Build a todo API with FastAPI and SQLite"
hermes build --repo ./my-project "Build a todo API with FastAPI and SQLite"
```

### State

Pipeline state is persisted between runs. Use `--resume` to continue an interrupted build, or inspect the saved state in `~/.hermes/multi_agent_builder/state/`.

### Termux Setup

On Termux, install the builder stack and run the pipeline:

```bash
# Install dependencies
pkg update && pkg install python nodejs git curl

# Clone repo
git clone https://github.com/tarisayulianti/hermes-agent-universal-builder.git
cd hermes-agent-universal-builder

# Install Python deps
pip install -r requirements/builder.txt

# Run builder
python -m multi_agent_builder.cli build "Build a todo API with FastAPI and SQLite"
```

> Note: On Termux, use `python -m multi_agent_builder.cli` instead of `hermes build` unless Hermes CLI is installed and on PATH.

## CLI vs Messaging Quick Reference

Hermes has two entry points: start the terminal UI with `hermes`, or run the gateway and talk to it from Telegram, Discord, Slack, WhatsApp, Signal, or Email. Once you're in a conversation, many slash commands are shared across both interfaces.

| Action | CLI | Messaging platforms |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Start chatting | `hermes` | Run `hermes gateway setup` + `hermes gateway start`, then send the bot a message |
| Start fresh conversation | `/new` or `/reset` | `/new` or `/reset` |
| Change model | `/model [provider:model]` | `/model [provider:model]` |
| Set a personality | `/personality [name]` | `/personality [name]` |
| Retry or undo the last turn | `/retry`, `/undo` | `/retry`, `/undo` |
| Compress context / check usage | `/compress`, `/usage`, `/insights [--days N]` | `/compress`, `/usage`, `/insights [days]` |
| Browse skills | `/skills` or `/<skill-name>` | `/<skill-name>` |
| Interrupt current work | `Ctrl+C` or send a new message | `/stop` or send a new message |
| Platform-specific status | `/platforms` | `/status`, `/sethome` |

For the full command lists, see the [CLI guide](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/user-guide/cli) and the [Messaging Gateway guide](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/user-guide/messaging).
